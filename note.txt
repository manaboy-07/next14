Data Fetching
1. Server Side Rendering (SSR)
2. Static Site Generation (SSG)
3. Incremental STatic Generation (ISR)
SSR- dynamic sever rendered data, new rendering cycle i.e cache: 'no-store;,
SSG- content that doesnt fetch frequently
ISR - {next: {revalidate: 20}},statically fetched at build time, ISR is best

export async function GET(request){

}
