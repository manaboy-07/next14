Please when reviewing kindly check the next05 page first and then the blog on how to generate dynamic pages and all
check the next07 for api and route handlers


You can create new pages in the app by adding a folder component
Link uses href
you can use a loading state, in the folder just name loading.tsx
folders can also have error, error.tsx and go to docs and copy
Next js applies it automatically
read the docs

NextJS 13.1 (reference dave gray on yt): 
You can do smth like page.module.css, 
also create automatic loading states,
when you create a folder like about folder that contains the about pages

NextJs 13.2 replace head.tsx
Usage of metadata


Dynamic Routing:
Create a route you want e.g [name]

MetaData - automaticlly changes title of page

DATA-FETCHING:
you can use server components
fetch data in parallel
loading ui, streaming an suspense




USEFUL NextJS thing for applications NextJs applies automatically:
1. loading with loading.tsx
2. error boundary error.tsx copy code from docs
3. provide built in not-found for error pages by convention of  not-found.tsx


Google SSG, SSR and ISR
SSG if you know the parameter in advanced

BASICS = blog, next05, codedev
API and Routing = rest, next07 or check for next-api on the desktop

Look for next-api folder - sample project and middleware
check the blog again on how to handle revalidation, using isr

Revalidation:  86400 also known as isr
config can only br in page or layout, check docs
background revalidation - time interval
On demand = based on an event

node script
require('crypto').randomBytes(16).toString('hex) //secret token in node js


For Mutating Data Crud operations check next 11 / mutation
also check docs in mutation page


cache - no store acheves the same thing with revalidate = 0

router.refresh() only works in a current route,
you can acheive same thing using prefecth = false

npm i @nextcanary - google it tho

Next Js helps in
Api routes
Pre-rendering
Support for Css modules
File based Routing
Authentication


For Better Segments and Layout Check codedev
to capture all params and also dynamic routes

codedev:
Optional and get all routes - docs folder
Dynamic Routes - product folder
When using links you and also add a replace prop 

Pre-rendering and Data fetching
1. Static Generation ; with and without data, ISG, , dynamic parameters
2. SSR, serverside rendering
Client Side data fetching


What is prerendering ?

Static Generation - A method or pre-rendering where the html pages are generated at build time
The html wil all the data that makes up the content of the web page are generated in advance when you build your application
This is the recommended method to pre-render pages whenever possible.
Blog, E-commerce etc...
Pages can be build once , cached by a cdn and served to the client almost instantly

Dont worry much about Static genration  in development mode, next js by default
It can be done with and without data

How to use Static Generation ? 
This is actually the default for it , the pages are built in build time

We can use it to fecth data iff we know all the inputs or entries
getSTatic Props runs at build time,
the getStaticProp functions runs in the page not component 
Html,JS and JSON file are generated
Check next-prernder folder

hollow circle  is Static
filled circle indicates SSG, automatically generated , used the getSTatic Props


You can import notfound from next navigation, set a condition and use it i.e notFOund()


Check the next 14 folder , hello-world next14 app
Private Folders naming convention usually begins with an underscore
For folder groups or like grouping folders use the parenthesis naming convention i.e (auth)


Layout also check the hello-wolrd in next14, you can add some header and navbar

Nested Layout, can be applied to specific parts of a component , still check the hello-world folder

MetaData Rules:
Both layout.tsx and Page.tsx files can export metadata. if defined in a layout , it applies to all pages in that layout, but if defined in a page , it appliesto only that page.

MetaData is read in order from the root level down ti the final page level

loading.tsx
error.tsx
not-found.tsx

are special filenames , you can easily look up gpt on how to use it
